## Le Wagon HTML / CSS challenges

Here is the roadmap of the day


### `01-profile-content`

A simple challenge to manipulate basic HTML tags and create a profile page with headers/texts/images/tables.

### `02-fonts-colors`

Add simple CSS rules to design fonts and colors of your profile page.

### `03-box-model`

Play with the box model (`margin/border/padding/width/height`) by splitting your profile informations into different `<div>`.


### `04-advanced-selectors`

Use advanced selectors (id, class, grouping, descendant selectors) to fine-tune your page with a more subtle design.

### `05-profile-dashboard`

Create a cool profile dashboard by inserting your infos into a nice 2D layout. You'll have to use most standard CSS positionning techniques.
